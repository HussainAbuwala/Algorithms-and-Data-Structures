Many applications require a dynamic set that supports only the dictionary operations
INSERT, SEARCH, and DELETE. For example, a compiler that translates a
programming language maintains a symbol table, in which the keys of elements
are arbitrary character strings corresponding to identifiers in the language. A hash
table is an effective data structure for implementing dictionaries. Although searching
for an element in a hash table can take as long as searching for an element in a
linked list - O(n) time in the worst case - in practice, hashing performs extremely
well.
