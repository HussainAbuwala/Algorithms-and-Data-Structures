For task - 4, i was facing some weird issues with the command line. Large text files takes a long time to encode and decode compared to when i am running the same file in pycharm. I have given an alternate function which asks for user input for file name , W and L for both encode and decode. I have also included the command line code i used which was giving me weird issues. Sorry for the trouble.
